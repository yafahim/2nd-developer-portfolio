        <h2> Importance of trust in leadership and business ethics </h2>
        <p>Trust is the most important business and brand asset you manage, especially in relationships with customers, clients, employees, and stakeholders.
            Our economy works because people trust each other and the businesses they support.
            
            When you consider the importance of trust in leadership and business ethics , you understand why trust is important to customers.
            
            One can argue that the sole purpose of marketing and communications is to earn and nurture trust.
            
            It is imperative for any values-led or purpose-driven business to hold trust as a core value that is owned by every employee—from the CEO to the front-line cteam that interacts with customers online, by phone, and in person—and is reinforced by acting and speaking in a manner that is consistent with your values, character, and culture.</p>
